# 📚 Online Bookstore Database Analysis (SQL)

"Data-driven analysis of a Bookstore Database using PostgreSQL to solve real-world business problems."

## 📌 Project Overview
Is project mein maine ek Online Bookstore ka relational database banaya hai aur uspar **Advanced SQL** ka use karke business insights nikale hain. Isme basic filtering se lekar advanced window functions tak ka use kiya gaya hai.

## 🚀 Business Questions & SQL Insights

Maine is analysis ko 3 levels mein divide kiya hai:

### 🟢 Level 1: Basic Exploratory Questions
1. **Retrieve all books belonging to the "Fiction" genre.**
2. **List books published after the year 1950, sorted by publication year.**
3. **Identify the Top 5 most expensive books in the store.**
4. **Find books with stock levels below 10 units (Restock Alert).**
5. **Count the total number of unique customers registered.**

### 🟡 Level 2: Intermediate Business Metrics
6. **Calculate the Total Revenue generated by each Genre.**
7. **Identify the Total Amount spent by each individual Customer.**
8. **List detailed Order Information, including Customer Name and Book Title.**
9. **Find the Most Popular Author based on the total quantity of books sold.**
10. **Identify Customers who have never placed an order (Lead Generation).**

### 🔴 Level 3: Advanced Analytical Insights (Window Functions & CTEs)
11. **Rank Books by Price within each Genre** (Using `DENSE_RANK`).
12. **Calculate the Cumulative (Running Total) Revenue over time.**
13. **Find the Top-Spending Customer in every City** (Using `PARTITION BY`).
14. **Segment Customers into 'VIP', 'Regular', and 'New'** (Using `CASE` Logic).
15. **Calculate the Month-over-Month (MoM) Percentage Growth in Revenue.**
